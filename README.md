# Dynamic Historical Biases

A collection of methods to analyze the changes in social biases and stereotypes over the past 200 years, using word embedding techniques on historical corpora.

## For the historical sources: 

We utilize **HistWords**, a brilliant collection of pre-trained vectors available at: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/
(Hamilton et al, 2018)

Here, we provide the tools to conduct analyses on the following corpora:

Google N-grams eng-all <br />
Google N-grams eng-fic <br />
*Corpus of Historical American English* (COHA)


## Requirements:
Python2 <br />
Python3

## Information on each file:

Note: When running the *freqscript.py* file - make sure to run using Python2!
All other .py files - Python3 works just fine.
Nishanth - find a way to add the freq.pkl files for eng-all and eng-fic. (Git LFS?)
